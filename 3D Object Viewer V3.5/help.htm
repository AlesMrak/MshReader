<p>3D Object Viewer allows you to view various 3D models.
The viewer can load a range of models including DirectX, 3DS, BSP maps and heightmap terrains. Viewing controls are simple, right click and hold on a
3D view to
rotate or hold both mouse buttons to zoom. There are two camera modes, orbit and explore. Use orbit to rotate quickly around the 3D object or explore for roaming around a bsp map or terrain. When using explore left click to move forward and hold shift to accelerate.</p>
